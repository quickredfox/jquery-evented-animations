# jQuery Evented Animations 0.0.1

Have you ever wanted your animations to trigger events when they start and when they complete? Well this
little ditty aims to do so by duck-puching $.fn.animate and adding some "trigger" hooks. Events generated by animations
can be bound and unbound using the appropriate bind()/unbind() jQuery methods. 

3 events are generated by each animation:

  * start.animate: When the animation begins 
  * step.animate: When the animation steps a "frame"
  * end.animate: When the animation is done
